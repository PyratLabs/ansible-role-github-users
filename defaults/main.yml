# defaults file for ansible-role-github-users

# Create users from a GitHub organisation. If your oranisation members don't
# have public membership, then you will need to specify an authentication
# method.
#
# Example:
#
#   github_users_org: PyratLabs
#
# User/Pass API Authentication Variables:
#
#   github_users_auth_user: someGitHubUsername
#   github_users_auth_pass: s0m3P@ssw0rD!
#
# OAuth2 Token API Authentication Variables:
#
#   github_users_oauth2_token: xxxxxx-yyyyyy-zzzzzz

github_users_org: false

# Create groups from GitHub teams, assign users to Groups by team membership
# This requires github_users_org to be defined.
github_users_org_group_by_teams: false

# Default groups, if set all users will be assigned to these groups.
#
# Example:
#
#   github_users_default_groups:
#     - users
#     - docker
#
# An empty list will automatically assign users to a group that matches their
# username., eg: UID=xanmanning GID=xanmanning
github_users_default_groups: []

# List of GitHub Users, if you have set github_users_org, this can be used to
# map users to specific groups. If you have not set github_users_org this will
# find users (regardless of organisation membership) and create users for them.
#
# Example:
#
# github_users:
#   - name: xanmanning
#     groups:
#       - wheel
#       - docker
#
# Or...
#
# github_users:
#   - name: xanmanning
github_users: []

# List of users who must be absent from the system. The other side of
# Joiners, Movers and Leavers - who has left the team and must be absent from
# all target systems?
#
# Example
#
#   github_users_absent:
#     - name: xanmanning
github_users_absent: []

# Should users keys discovered on GitHub be their exclusive keys? ie. Should
# we remove any other keys that are in .ssh/authorized_keys.
# By default we have this as false as a user may have keys from their mobile
# client.
github_users_authorized_keys_exclusive: false

# Authentication for using GitHub API. If you are taking users from an
# Organisation then you may need to authenticate with the API, with a valid
# user that can list Org members. If you do not set these then only public
# members can be read from GitHub.
#
# User/Pass Auth. It is not recommended to use User/Pass authentication
# However if you do, ensure the secret information is projected with
# ansible-vault.
#
# github_users_auth_user: someGitHubUsername
# github_users_auth_pass: s0m3P@ssw0rD!
#
# Alternatively, use OAuth2 token, this is a better solution as tokens cna be
# easily revoked. It is highly recommended that this is also protected with
# ansible-vault.
